## Example: 

_**Scribbles Software**_, an EdTech company that serves over 10,000 schools and manages more than 25 million student transcripts, uses _**Amazon Managed Blockchain with Hyperledger Fabric**_ to give K–12 students ownership of their academic records. Through this blockchain-based system, students can securely share their transcripts, choice certifications, and earned achievements directly with potential employers, eliminating the need to request new certified copies from their schools. On the verification side, the platform allows anyone to quickly confirm the authenticity of a student’s record through the blockchain, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual verification processes.
